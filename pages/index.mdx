# 🖖 Hi!<br/>I'm Anton, a designer with engineering mindset, based in 🇰🇷 South Korea.

<big>
  I successfully built bank applications, and now am open to new horizons. In the next few years, I am going to design human-to-machine interfaces for 👾 AI, 🤖 robots and 🚀 spaceships. I’m so excited about future-centered design and look forward to sharing my skills and experience. **<a href="mailto:basistov@gmail.com" title="Mail Me">Get in touch!</a>**
