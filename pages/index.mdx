# ðŸ–– Hi!<br/>I'm Anton, aÂ designer with engineering mindset

<big>
  I successfully built bank applications, and now am open to new horizons. InÂ the next few years, I am going to design human-to-machine interfaces for ðŸ‘¾ AI, ðŸ¤– robots and ðŸš€ spaceships. Iâ€™m so excited about future-centered design and look forward to sharing my skills and experience. **<a href="mailto:basistov@gmail.com" title="Mail Me">Get in touch!</a>**
